### Raphael Malburg
#### Software Developer
I have been building projects with TypeScript and React. For styling, I employ a combination of Tailwind, CSS, and Sass to create responsive designs. When working on full-stack applications, I leverage my skills in both Next.js and .NET with C#, to deliver comprehensive solutions that cover both client and server-side requirements.


Skills: React | Next JS | Typescript | Tailwind | Prisma | .NET | Zustand | Sanity CMS | Figma | HTML | CSS | SQL  | SASS
